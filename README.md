## Architecture and Design
The TGSOC website was designed and developed using a modern, scalable, and modular architecture to ensure that it can handle a high volume of traffic and provide a seamless user experience. The following are the key components of the TGSOC website architecture:

### Front-ENd 
The front-end of the TGSOC website was built using the following technologies:
- HTML, CSS3, and Javascript for the User Interface
- Bootstrap for responsive design and layout

### Version Control & Automation
Git was used for version control, with frequent commits and branching to enable easy collaboration and experimentation. Continuous integration and deployment were handled using automated tools and services, such as GitHub Actions and Netlify.

## APIs and Integrations
The TGSOC website integrates with a number of APIs and third-party services to provide users with real-time information about cryptocurrency and financial markets. One such integration is the LiveCoinWatch API, which is used to display live price data for different cryptocurrencies on the homepage of the website.

The LiveCoinWatch API is a simple and easy-to-use API that provides real-time price data for thousands of cryptocurrencies. The API is used to display a live ticker of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, as well as a list of the top 10 movers in the market.

To integrate the LiveCoinWatch API into the TGSOC website, we used the following code:
```
<section id="home">
<script defer src="https://www.livecoinwatch.com/static/lcw-widget.js"></script>
<div class="livecoinwatch-widget-5" lcw-base="USD" lcw-color-tx="#999999" lcw-marquee-1="coins" lcw-marquee-2="movers" lcw-marquee-items="10" ></div>
```
This code embeds the LiveCoinWatch widget into the homepage of the website, allowing users to view live price data for different cryptocurrencies.

By integrating with APIs and third-party services, the TGSOC website was designed to provide users with real-time information and data about cryptocurrency and financial markets.


## Development Process 
The TGSOC website was designed and developed using a lean methodology, with a focus on rapid prototyping, experimentation, and user feedback. The website was developed iteratively, with new features and improvements added in small, incremental steps.
